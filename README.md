## About

Building **[CliniChat](https://clinichat.ai)** - AI-powered healthcare management for clinics and dental practices. We're rethinking how healthcare providers handle patient communication, scheduling, and day-to-day operations.

Previously built **Dextego** as CTO & Co-founder - real-time AI coaching for enterprise sales teams.

Before startups, I worked on conversational AI at **Skit.ai**, **Frrole AI**, and **Humantic AI**.

## What I Work On

I spend most of my time at the intersection of **AI systems**, **real-time infrastructure**, and **healthcare technology**.

The problems I find most interesting involve building software that needs to be simultaneously intelligent, fast, and trustworthy - especially in domains where reliability isn't optional.

## How I Think About Building

**On AI in production** - The model is rarely the bottleneck. What matters is everything around it: latency, reliability, cost, evaluation. Production AI is fundamentally a systems problem.

**On healthcare software** - Healthcare moves slowly for good reasons. The challenge is building modern, intuitive experiences without compromising the trust and safety that patients and providers depend on.

**On real-time systems** - Real-time isn't about speed; it's about predictability. Tail latency matters more than throughput, and architectural choices made early determine what's possible later.

**On building companies** - The best technical decisions are the ones that buy you time to learn. Optimize for iteration speed early, correctness later - but know when to flip that.
